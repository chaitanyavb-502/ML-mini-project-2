## Project Structure:
We have structured our project into separate folders to maintain clarity and organization. Each part of the mini-project has its own dedicated folder, which contains:
- **Main Approach**: The primary method we have applied to solve the problem.
- **Other Approaches**: Additional methods and further exploration for alternative solutions.

### Folder Breakdown:
1. **Task 1**
   - `Main Approach`: Contains the main method used.
   - `Other Approaches`: Contains other approaches we explored.
   
2. **Task 2**
   - `Main Approach`: Contains the main method used.
   - `Other Approaches`: Contains other approaches we explored.

3. **Project Documentation**
    - Contains all the relevant latex files, images, pdfs, etc.
